Simple PCIBEX Lexical Decision Task script to be used in the Research Methods in Linguistics course of the MA in Theoretical and Experimental Linguistics (UPV/EHU).
This script uses the coding style of the previous version of PCIBEX (IbexFarm). Hence, the experimental stimuli are directly included in the "data_includes/example_data.js" file, at the end. 
The aesthetics of the experiment can be modified in the "js_includes/AcceptabilityJudgment_EN.js" controller file, which overrides the default "AcceptabilityJudgment.js" controller.
