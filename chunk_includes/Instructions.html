This test consists of about 60 trials, in each of which you will see a string of letters. Your task is to decide whether this is an existing English word or not. If you think it is an existing English word, you click on “yes”, and if you think it is not an existing English word, you click on “no”.

If you are sure that the word exists, even though you don’t know its exact meaning, you may still respond “yes”. But if you are not sure if it is an existing word, you should respond “no”.

You have as much time as you like for each decision. This part of the experiment will take about 5 minutes.

Please note: sometimes it takes a while until next item appears after you have clicked on “yes” or “no”. In that case, please do not click again but wait for the new item to appear.
